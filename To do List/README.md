# How It Works
The user types a task into the input field.

On clicking the Add button or pressing Enter, the task is added to the list.

Clicking on a task toggles a checked state (task completed).

Clicking the × icon deletes the task.

All tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage, so they persist even after a refresh.
